A basic React native app, with the purpose of displaying addresses of friends.

The app makes use of the Facebook SDK for React Native, 
which is a wrapper around the Facebook SDKs for iOS and Android, 
allowing for Facebook integration in native apps. 

By logging in with facebook, as user accepts to share his friends with the Youddress app.
Because of this, users can see facebook friends, that also make use of the app and look up their home address.

## Purpose

I build this project as part of my final assessment at Codaisseur. After two weeks of training and workshop with Reactjs and Redux, I saw a challenge in starting with React native. The project was build in a single week and uses a [Rails API](https://github.com/ckreeftmeijer/API---Youddress) for accessing user data.
